### Improvements I Probably Won't Get Around To Doing

* [ ] Display past game history
* [ ] Game replay
* [ ] Show when text box entry is invalid
* [ ] Display where other players' mice are hovering
* [ ] Gesture-based zoom of canvas (for mobile in particular)
* [ ] Draw highlights at high DPI
* [ ] Optimize drawing so larger board sizes can be used
* [ ] Color recursive reveals by the player's color, but with lower saturation
* [ ] Distinguish players at a more granular level than IP (perhaps with cookies)
* [ ] Randomize colors
* [ ] Make player name and color unique (as possible)
* [ ] Do not replace currently displayed players when replacing IDs
* [ ] Fix hanging behavior from nginx setup
* [ ] If left + right click, don't left or right click
